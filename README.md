gobuggery
=======

Wrapper for the basic remote debugger connection to the
github.com/bnagy/rBuggery json stub ( json_debug_server )

TODO:
=======

Very few of the rBuggery methods are mapped over to idiomatic Go. Pretty much
all that's working so far is Execute ( to run any windbg command ) and local
kernel connection.
